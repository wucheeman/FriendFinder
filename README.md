# Project Name!

## What the project does
This is an implementation of the FriendFinder app, done as homework for the February 2018 UNC Coding Boot Camp. Comments on the app and code will be added here when it is complete.

## How to get started with the application
You can use the game online at Heroku eventually, but it's not yet ready.

## Authors
This application is being built and will be maintained by Mark Hainline. Help should not be needed, and will not be available.
