# Find an Author!

## What the project does
This is an implementation of the FriendFinder app, done as homework for the February 2018 UNC Coding Boot Camp. This version helps a user find an author who has interesting views and might be someone who (if they were still alive) the user would like to get to know.

## How to get started with the application
You can try the app online at Heroku at https://aqueous-bastion-22790.herokuapp.com/ . Click the button to go to the survey. Enter your name and email, and then read the 10 quotations, each one from one of the authors who might be matched. Record whether you agree or disagree with the sentiment express in the quotation and how strongly you feel about it. The app compares your scores with scores for each of the authors (sadly, created at random by a computer). It displays the name and picture of your best match.

## Authors
This application is being built and will be maintained by Mark Hainline. Help should not be needed, and will not be available.
