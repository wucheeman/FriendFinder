# Find an Author!

## What the project does
This is an implementation of the FriendFinder app, done as homework for the February 2018 UNC Coding Boot Camp. This version helps a user find an author who has interesting views and might be someone who (if they were still alive) the user would like to get to know.

## How to get started with the application
You can try the app online at Heroku at https://aqueous-bastion-22790.herokuapp.com/ . On the home page, click the button to go to the survey. Enter your name and a link to a recent photo of yourself. Next read the 10 quotations, each from one of the authors who might be matched. Record whether you agree or disagree with the sentiment expressed in the quotation and how strongly you feel about it. The app compares your scores with scores for each of the authors. (Sadly, these were created at random by a computer and do not reflect the true views of the person.) The app then displays the name and picture of your best match.

If you want to see the full set of authors, click the link to the 'API Friends List' that's on the bottom of either page.  The other link brings you here, to this repository.

## Authors
This application was built and will be maintained by Mark Hainline. Help should not be needed, and will not be available.
