TEST RESULTS - FRIENDFINDER RUNNING ON LOCALHOST

d = deferred
e = met by enhancement
f = failed
p = passed
s = skipped
w = waiting for further work

Requirements
============
[p] Application has this directory structure:
    FriendFinder
    - .gitignore
    - app
      - data
        - friends.js
      - public
        - home.html
        - survey.html
      - routing
        - apiRoutes.js
        - htmlRoutes.js
    - node_modules
    - package.json
    - server.js
[p] Application has survey of 10 questions
[p] Each question has scale of 1 - 5 based on user agreement/disagreement
[p] server.js requires 'express', 'body-parser' and 'path'
[p] `htmlRoutes.js` includes two routes:
   () GET Route to `/survey` which should display the survey page.
   () Default, catch-all route that leads to `home.html`
[p] `apiRoutes.js` includes two routes:
   () GET route with the url `/api/friends`. This displays a JSON of all possible friends.
   () POST route to `/api/friends`. This handles incoming survey results and provides compatibility logic.
[p] Application data are stored in `app/data/friends.js` as an array of JSON objects.
[p] Each JSON object in friends.js has this format:.
    {
      "name":"Ahmed",
      "photo":"https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_400_400/p/6/005/064/1bd/3435aa3.jpg",
      "scores":[
          5,
          1,
          4,
          4,
          5,
          1,
          2,
          5,
          4,
          1
        ]
    }
[p] Compatibility logic sums absolute value of differences between user and each candidate friend's score on survey. 
[p] Closest match is declared to be candidate with least total difference
[p] Closest match displays as a modal window, with name and picture of match
[p] Application must prevent submission of survey until all questions are answered.
